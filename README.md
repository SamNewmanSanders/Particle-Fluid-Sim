# Fluid Sim 

## Description
Project to try make a gas fluid sim. Didn't try to make it very realistic, just wanted the mechanics to work.
Used a grid based search system to minimise particle checks and a smoothing radius density calculation to move the particles.

You need SFML and TGui to run this.
